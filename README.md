## About the website
[iNoticed](https://iNoticed.org) is Natalie's personal project about kindness, being valued, and a new way of dating. 

The idea is that when you are in public and you notice someone doing something nice, or having a bad day, or you're just attracted to someone, you hand them a card. There are specific cards to hand out depending on the situation. 

The dating section is a full-blown dating app - you hand a card to someone you'd like to date, and they visit the website to check out your profile and message you. It makes it easier to approach people.

## Tools
Natalie created every aspect of the site using JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, SCSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, particles.js, XML, AJAX, MySQL/SQL, Git, Bash, Python, and zippopotam.us.

## Installation

This is just a website, so go to the [home page](https://iNoticed.org) to view the site, or you can download the files and create a localhost on your computer.
