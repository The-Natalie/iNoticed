				<p class="firstWord">Somebody  gave you this card because they thought you were attractive.</p>
				<p class="firstWord">If  you received this card, but aren't interested, hopefully you were flattered. Maybe you should tell your single friends about this site...</p>
				<p class="firstWord">However,  if you are interested and would like to view their profile, go directly to the link on the card.</p>
				<p class="firstWord">You  don't have to create an account to view someone's profile. Although, they might have some of their information hidden until you do.</p>
				<p class="firstWord" style="text-align: center;">But  you have to create an account if you want to message somebody.</p>
				<p class="firstWord">Signing  up doesn't cost anything, but if you would like to receive cards of your own to hand out, they will cost a few dollars. That option will always be available to you while you have your account.</p>
				<p class="firstWord">What's  different about this dating site is that these people have already interacted (whether big or small) in real life. Out of fear of rejection or for other reasons, the card was handed out.</p>
				<p class="firstWord">Since  these people met in real life, this site isn't for searching for love (or whatever) online. So, there is no search option.</p>
