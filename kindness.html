			<h1>Kindness</h1>
			<div class="div-of-ps">
				<img class="kindness-page-img" src="/images/Card_Kindness.png" width="677" height="398"/>
				<p class="firstWord">Somebody  thought your act of kindness was meaningful enough to give you this card. More than likely the person you were kind to was pleased and passed on your kindness, perhaps in their own way, to someone else. The person who gave you this card was certainly pleased, and as a card holder also passed on the kindness.</p>

				<p class="firstWord">That's  at least four people you randomly made happy today.</p>

				<p class="firstWord">Four  people, one of whom might have been having suicidal thoughts, but saw your gesture as a sign and decided not to take their life today.</p>

				<p class="firstWord">One  of those people might have been on their way home to take their anger out on their spouse or child by beating them, but your kindness no longer made them angry.</p>

				<p class="firstWord">Sometimes  a simple interaction can make a difference to someone in ways that no one will ever know. Maybe your ten second interaction delayed a person just enough that they weren't in an accident with the person who ran that red light.</p> 

				<p class="firstWord" style="text-align: right;">Or  maybe they weren't hit by that stray bullet.</p> 

				<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: 1.35em; color: #c25656; font-style: italic;">Or </span> maybe they were half a block away when that tree fell over<br />in the wind storm, instead of being directly under it.</p>

				<p style="text-align: center;" class="firstWord">We'll  never know...</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;" class="firstWord">Hopefully  this will inspire you to continue to do good things for others.</p>

				<p class="firstWord">Pass on a card to someone you think needs to be noticed.</p>

				<p style="font-size: 1em; color: #000000;" class="firstWord">If  you'd like to receive a set of cards to pass on to others, fill out the form below, and we'll be in touch with you ASAP.</p>

				<p style="font-size: 1em; color: #000000; margin-top: -15px" class="firstWord">A  tiny fee will be required, which we will inform you of before your order is finalized. Of course, if you think the fee is too much, you may choose to opt out.</p>
